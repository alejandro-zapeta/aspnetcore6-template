# aspnetcore6-template
NetCore 6 REST API - Create, Update, Read, Delete.

hey guys, this a template of a netcore 6 rest api working already. I am using SqlServer, but you only have to change 1 line in the Program.cs to your preferred Database.

I think the most important part of this project is the Program.cs, that is quite different than NetCore5.

And yea, if you want to run this project, clone it, and dotnet run.

Btw, i have a YouTube Channel, that i explain in more details how to do this stuff.
